# Airlinedata_Analysis
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **database normalization** and **advanced SQL analysis** using an airline flight pricing dataset.  
The original dataset contained repeated textual values such as airline names, cities, classes, and raw ticket prices â€” all stored in a single table.  
We normalized the data into multiple relational tables in **MySQL** to improve data integrity, reduce redundancy, and enable efficient querying.

## Objectives
- **Normalize** a raw CSV dataset into **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**.
- Maintain **referential integrity** using foreign keys.
- Enable **advanced analytical queries** for insights such as:
  - Cheapest and most expensive flights.
  - Price trends as departure date approaches.
  - Airline performance and profitability.
  - Popular routes and average flight duration.
